# Atomic Server

**Atomic Server** keeps models on a machine — Linux, Windows or macOS, usually a headless server — and
serves them over an OpenAI-compatible API on `http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1`. Its command is **`atc`**. It
embeds [`atomic-chat-core`](https://github.com/AtomicBot-ai/atomic-chat-core) as a library and ships as
one binary per platform, with no engine inside: engines are installed on demand, and the core picks the
build for the hardware. The same server has a web admin on `127.0.0.1:1338` and a terminal UI (bare `atc`)
for people who would rather not type commands. Atomic Server and the Atomic Chat desktop app are separate
products for different audiences: they share the core (and the core's per-user managed-runtime root) and
nothing else. The words used everywhere — server, engine, engine build, model, run, unload — are defined
in [`docs/concepts.md`](docs/concepts.md).

> **Status: scaffold.** The command tree, help texts, config, server lifecycle, terminal UI, admin, build
> and release pipeline are real. Commands marked **stub** parse their flags and print their help, but
> running one exits with code 3 (`ATC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) and names the iteration that implements it.
> [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) is generated from the command specs and is the authoritative list.

## Quick start on a server

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/AtomicBot-ai/atomic-chat-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, in PowerShell: `irm https://github.com/AtomicBot-ai/atomic-chat-cli/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex`.

The installer downloads the release's `SHA256SUMS`, picks the binary for this machine, verifies it, puts it
in `~/.local/bin/atc` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\atc\atc.exe` on Windows) and adds that directory to `PATH`.
`ATC_INSTALL_DIR`, `ATC_VERSION` (a tag, e.g. `v0.1.0`), `ATC_NO_PATH=1` and `ATC_REPO` override the defaults.

Getting a model to answer takes three steps, as in the desktop app (iteration 2; stubs in this build):

```sh
atc engines install              # the engine build the core picks for this hardware
atc models pull Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF
atc run Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF       # starts it on the running server; `atc unload` stops it
```

What runs today:

```sh
atc                  # on a terminal: the terminal UI — Overview, Logs, Config, Doctor, Commands (? for keys)
atc doctor           # versions, data folder, config, ports 1337/1338, PATH, GPU driver
atc start            # the server (core, API, web admin) in the background; it outlives this command
atc status           # pid, versions, API endpoint, running models, admin URL   (--json for one document)
atc admin            # prints http://127.0.0.1:1338/#token=… and opens a browser
atc stop             # graceful; --force while other commands are attached, --kill after the timeout
```

## Commands

| Group | Command | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server | `atc start` / `stop` / `restart` | The server: core, API and web admin in the background | works (`start --foreground` is a stub) |
| Server | `atc status` | The server, the API endpoint, running models, the admin URL | works (`--watch` is a stub) |
| Server | `atc logs` | Tail of the server log | works (`-f` is a stub) |
| Models & engines | `atc run <model>` / `atc unload <model>` | Start a downloaded model on the active engine; stop it | stub (iteration 2) |
| Models & engines | `atc models search\|pull\|list\|rm\|info` | The catalog and the model files | stub (`pull`: iteration 2; the rest: 3) |
| Models & engines | `atc engines list\|install\|status\|rm` | Engines (llama.cpp, MLX, TensorRT-LLM) and their builds; installing one prepares what it needs | stub (`install`: iteration 2; the rest: 4) |
| Models & engines | `atc hardware show\|refresh` | What the core sees of the GPU and CPU | stub (iteration 4) |
| Access | `atc api start\|stop\|status` | The OpenAI-compatible API on the running server | stub (iteration 2) |
| Access | `atc api key show\|set\|rotate\|clear` | The API key (a core setting) | stub (iteration 3) |
| Access | `atc admin [open\|status\|token]` | Sign-in link, where the admin listens, token rotation | works |
| Access | `atc tui` | The terminal UI, explicitly (what bare `atc` opens on a terminal) | works (Models and Downloads screens come with iterations 2–3) |
| System | `atc config get\|set\|unset\|list\|path` | `atc` settings | works (`engine.*` keys are a stub) |
| System | `atc doctor` | Diagnostic table with hints | works (GPU: NVIDIA only; Docker check skipped) |
| System | `atc service install\|uninstall\|status\|start\|stop` | The server as an OS service | stub (iteration 6) |
| System | `atc update` | Self-update from GitHub Releases | `--check` works; applying is a stub (iteration 6) |
| System | `atc version`, `atc completion <shell>` | Versions; bash/zsh/fish/powershell completion | works |

Hidden: `atc daemon` (the server process itself, which `start` spawns) and `atc host-step exec
<request.json>` (the privileged helper for managed runtimes).

Bare `atc` opens the terminal UI only on an interactive terminal; in a pipe, a script, a service unit or
with `--json` it prints this help and exits 2, as before. Leaving the UI (`q`) never stops the server.

Global flags go anywhere on the line: `--json`, `-v/--verbose`, `-q/--quiet`, `-y/--yes`,
`--data-folder <path>`, `--no-color`, `-h/--help`, `--version`. With `--json` a command prints exactly one
JSON document on stdout; an error is `{"error":{"code","message","details?","hint?"}}` on stderr.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` runtime error, `2` usage (also bare `atc` and bare groups such as `atc models`),
`3` not implemented in this build, `130` interrupted.

## Where data lives

```
<data> = <system data>/atomic-chat-cli/data      --data-folder or ATC_DATA_FOLDER override it
<data>/atomic-core/           the core: instance.lock, control-token (0600), settings.json, processes.json, logs/
<data>/llamacpp/models/       GGUF models, one folder with model.yml each (both llama.cpp providers)
<data>/<provider>/backends/   engine builds the core installs
<data>/atc/                   what only atc owns
  config.json                 settings (0644, written atomically; unknown keys are kept)
  secrets.json                0600: hfToken, adminPassword
  run/daemon.json             pid, instance_id, state (starting|ready), atc/core versions, control_url, admin_url, started_at
  run/admin-token             0600: the admin login token
  run/host-steps/             <step_id>.request.json, <step_id>.result.json, journal.json
  logs/daemon.log             the server's stderr
  cache/                      catalog and recommendation caches (iteration 3)
```

`<system data>` is `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `~/.local/share` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS
and `%APPDATA%` on Windows — the core's own rule, so the core and `atc` always agree. The desktop app's data
folder is refused: the two products never share models, settings or a lock.

## Configuration

Precedence: command flags > `ATC_<SECTION>_<KEY>` environment variables > `<data>/atc/config.json` >
defaults. `atc config list` shows every key with its value and where it came from.

```sh
atc config set api.port 1337              # written to config.json
ATC_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 atc status           # api.host from the environment for this run
atc config set models.autoLoad qwen3-8b,gemma-4b
atc config path
```

Keys are `api.*`, `admin.*`, `engines.*` (`engines.default` is the engine `atc run` falls back on),
`models.*`, `managed.*`, `proxy.*`, `update.*`, `telemetry.*`, `log.*` (the table is `src/config/schema.ts`). Engine parameters
(`engine.<provider>.<key>`) belong to the core's settings; forwarding them through `atc config` is a stub.
A config file written by a newer `atc` is refused with a hint rather than half-read; an older one is
migrated (version 2 dropped the `serve.*` keys along with the `serve` command).

## The web admin

```sh
atc admin                    # http://127.0.0.1:1338/#token=<admin token>, opened in a browser
atc admin status             # where it listens
atc admin token --rotate     # new token; old login links stop working
```

The admin listens on loopback only. The token in the URL fragment is exchanged once for an `HttpOnly`
cookie, so it never reaches a query string or a log. The core's control token never leaves the server: the
page talks to `/api/*` and the server proxies an allowlist of control routes. From another machine, forward
the port instead of exposing it:

```sh
ssh -L 1338:127.0.0.1:1338 user@server
```

`--host 0.0.0.0` is refused until the password login lands (iteration 5).

## Development

Prerequisites: Bun 1.3.10 (the package manager — `bun.lock` is committed — and the compiler of the binary)
and Node 22 (the development and test runtime; scripts run as `npm run …`, like in the core). The core comes
from npm as `@atomic-chat/core` at an exact version.

```sh
bun install                  # the core from npm and the admin-ui workspace
npm test                     # unit + contract projects on Node
npm run build:bin            # embeds the admin SPA (or the placeholder) and compiles dist/bin/atc-<triple>
npm run verify               # lint, typecheck, format, tests, build, UI, binary, e2e, runtime-compat
```

To develop against a local core checkout, build it there (`npm run build`), run `bun link` in it and
`bun link @atomic-chat/core` here; `package.json` and `bun.lock` stay untouched and `bun install --force` puts
the pinned version back. `node dist/bin.js …` runs the CLI from source after `npm run build`; `npm run dev` in
`packages/admin-ui` runs the SPA against a server started with `atc admin --no-open`.

Note: the core's own CLI defaults its public API to port 6767; `atc` uses 1337, like the desktop app.
