# Roadmap

The scaffold (iteration 1, 2026-09-24) ships the command tree, the daemon, the admin server and the
build/release pipeline; every command that is not implemented yet is a stub that exits 3 and names its
iteration. This file is the plan behind those stubs. `src/cli/not-implemented.ts` is the machine-readable
half of it: a test keeps the registry and the command tree in sync, and `docs/commands.md` shows the
status of every command. Iterations are ordered by what unlocks the product's one promise — *one command
puts an engine, a model and an OpenAI-compatible API on a server* — and each names what it depends on.

## Where things stand

Working today: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`, `admin` (token login, live dashboard),
`tui` (what bare `atc` opens on a terminal: Overview, Logs, Config, Doctor), `config`, `doctor`,
`update --check`, `version`, `completion`, the hidden `daemon` and `host-step exec`. The daemon boots
the core in-process, pushes hardware facts to it, serves the web admin and runs the host-step loop. See
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for how the pieces fit.

Stubbed: `serve`, `run`, `models *`, `engines *`, `setup`, `hardware *`, `api *`, `service *`,
`update` (apply), `logs --follow`, `status --watch`, `config engine.*`.

## Iterations

### Iteration 2 — serve, run, the API

The product's core promise. **Goal:** `atc serve <model>` on a clean server ends with a working
`http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1`.

- `serve`: ensure an engine pack (the core's `POST /backends/:provider/install`, chosen from the pushed
  hardware facts), pull the model when it is not installed (iteration 3's installer; until then a
  Hugging Face `owner/repo` through the core's `downloadHfModel`), start the daemon, load the model,
  start the public API, print the URL. Returns once the model answers; the daemon keeps running.
- `run`: the same in the foreground for Docker and systemd; `--no-model` runs the daemon alone; SIGTERM
  unloads and stops cleanly.
- `api start|stop|status` over the core's `/server` routes; `api.autoStart` and `models.autoLoad` honoured
  at daemon start (`PublicServerKeeper`).
- Replace an idle daemon of an older `atc`/core after an upgrade instead of refusing to attach.
- `status --watch`, `logs --follow`, `config engine.<provider>.<key>` forwarded to `PATCH /settings/:provider`.
  `logs --follow` reads through `followLog` (`src/daemon/log-follow.ts`), which the TUI's Logs screen
  already uses.
- Terminal UI: the API card on Overview gets start/stop keys (`atc api start|stop`), and the header the
  GPU the prober found.
- **Done when:** the e2e suite serves a small GGUF through the compiled binary on all five CI platforms and
  a `curl` to `/v1/chat/completions` answers; `atc run` survives a SIGTERM without orphaning the engine.

### Iteration 3 — models

**Goal:** models come from the catalog or Hugging Face, with progress, and stay manageable.

- `CatalogClient` over `atomic-chat-model-catalog` (`catalog.json.gz`, MiniSearch index) and
  `atomic-chat-conf/models/recommended.json` (hardware tiers), cached under `<data>/atc/cache/` with ETag
  and a one-hour TTL, offline fallback.
- `ModelResolver`: `owner/repo`, `owner/repo:file.gguf`, catalog alias, `auto` by VRAM tier; `--quant`.
- `ModelInstaller` on the core's `Downloader` and `ModelRegistry` (`@atomic-chat/core/models`,
  `/downloads`): disk preflight through `POST /disk/available`, resume, sha256, `model.yml`, optional
  `mmproj`; progress on the terminal and as `atc:download` events for the admin and the TUI.
- `models search|pull|list|rm|info|load|unload`; `api key show|set|rotate|clear` (the key is the core's
  `server.api_key` setting; a non-loopback API without a key is refused unless `--insecure-no-key`).
- Terminal UI: the Models and Downloads screens (see [The terminal UI](#the-terminal-ui)).
- **Done when:** `atc models pull` resumes an interrupted download and refuses a wrong checksum;
  `atc serve <alias>` works from a catalog alias; the admin's Models page lists installed models; a model
  can be pulled and loaded from the TUI with live progress.

### Iteration 4 — engines, setup, the managed runtime

**Goal:** `atc setup` prepares a machine, including TensorRT-LLM through Docker, with consent and
privileges handled honestly.

- `engines list|install|status|rm` over the core's backend routes; `hardware show|refresh` with AMD
  (`rocm-smi`, sysfs) and Intel probing added to NVIDIA.
- `setup`: probe → plan → consent → operation, following the core's `/environments` routes; relogin and
  reboot states resume on the next `atc` start.
- Real elevation strategies: `sudo` on a terminal, `pkexec` in a desktop session, UAC on Windows; the
  helper (`atc host-step exec`) runs the recipes the core exports, verifies their digests, and never
  touches the control API.
- `doctor`: Docker/WSL and driver checks.
- **Depends on the core:** the `feat/tenzor-rt` branch merged over 0.5.x, `provisionerFor()` implemented,
  recipes with digests and step parameters exported through `@atomic-chat/core/host`, a `managedRuntimes`
  option on `AtomicCore.create` for host facts. `atc` will target that core version exactly.
- Terminal UI: the Setup screen, the same operation as `atc setup` shown as a stepper.
- **Done when:** on an Ubuntu box with an NVIDIA card, `atc setup --tensorrt` ends in `ready` after one
  `sudo` prompt and one re-login, and `atc serve --engine tensorrt-llm <checkpoint>` answers.

### Iteration 5 — the admin pages

**Goal:** the browser front end catches up with the terminal one, for people who avoid terminals. (The
terminal UI shipped early, on 2026-09-25, and grows a screen per iteration instead.)

Admin pages, lifted from the desktop web-app where possible (`docs/admin-ui.md`):

- API Server (state, start/stop, key, trusted hosts), Models (installed, hub, downloads with progress),
  Engines (packs, optimal, install); `PATCH /api/config`; a password login so the admin may listen on a
  non-loopback address when a server has no SSH access.

- **Done when:** a model can be pulled and loaded from the browser, with live progress, and no front end
  offers anything that has no plain-command equivalent.

### Iteration 6 — service, update, doctor

- `service install|uninstall|status|start|stop`: systemd (user and system), launchd, a Windows logon task,
  with a wrapper-based Windows service to follow.
- `update` applies: download the asset for this platform, verify against `SHA256SUMS`, replace the binary
  (rename on POSIX, move-aside on Windows), re-exec, tell a managed service to restart.
- `doctor` completes (proxy reachability, engine and model sanity), coverage floors in CI.
- **Done when:** a fresh server goes from the installer to a service that survives a reboot, and
  `atc update` upgrades it in place.

### Iteration 7 — the admin's setup wizard, logs, settings, hardware

- The managed-runtime wizard in the browser (`SetupState` stepper on live operations), the daemon log with
  live tail, settings (proxy, telemetry, tokens), the hardware page with live GPU usage.
- **Done when:** iteration 4's setup can be driven end to end from the browser, including the
  elevation prompt shown as instructions when it cannot be automated.

### Iteration 8 — signing and notarisation

- Sign the macOS binaries and notarise them, sign the Windows binaries, on the same recipe atomic-agent
  uses; the installer verifies the signature before swapping the binary in.

## The terminal UI

Bare `atc` on an interactive terminal opens a full-screen, keyboard-driven screen on
[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) (React for the terminal), the stack atomic-agent's TUI is
built on; `atc tui [--screen <name>]` opens it explicitly. Without a terminal (a pipe, systemd, cron,
`docker run` without `-t`) or with `--json`, bare `atc` prints help and exits 2, and `atc tui` exits 2
naming `atc status --json` and `atc admin`. It is a front end over the daemon, never the only one:
everything it does exists as a plain command, it holds no lease, starts nothing on its own, and leaving
it never stops the daemon. The decision and its limits are in
[the ADR](decisions/2026-09-25-open-the-terminal-ui-by-default-on-a-terminal.md).

```

- **Welcome:** on every screen, when the terminal has at least 64 columns and 24 rows, a box greets you
  the way Claude Code does: the Atomic Chat logo in half blocks (the "/" bar brighter, as it lies on top
  in the real mark), the product name *Atomic Server*, versions, the daemon's state and the first keys.
  Only the terminal's size decides it, never the tab or an overlay, so switching screens moves nothing;
  every screen and overlay fits the 9 lines left under it at 80×24. **Header:** on a smaller terminal,
  one line instead: `✳ Atomic Server · atc … · core … · daemon up …` (the GPU joins in iteration 2).
  **Tabs:** in the order below; `←`/`→` go round them, `1`–`4` jump, Tab steps. **Status line:** a
  spinner while something runs, else the last thing that happened. **Footer:** only the keys that apply
  now, always visible; `?` lists them all.
- **Overview (now):** the admin dashboard's cards in its order and words — Daemon, Core, API server,
  Loaded models, Pending host steps, Admin — one line each. `s` starts a stopped daemon (`atc start`),
  `S` and `R` stop and restart after a y/n question (`atc stop`, `atc restart`), `a` shows the admin
  login link (`atc admin --no-open`) and `o` opens it in a browser.
- **Logs (now):** the daemon log's tail with level colours, following new lines; `↑↓`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`,
  `g`/`G` scroll, `f` toggles follow, `/` filters.
- **Config (now):** every field with its value and source; Enter flips a boolean, moves an enum on, or
  edits a value inline (`atc config set`); `u` resets it (`atc config unset`). A value an environment
  variable overrides is marked, and a change while the daemon runs says to restart it.
- **Doctor (now):** the `atc doctor` checks with their marks and hints; `r` runs them again.
- **Models (iteration 3):** installed models with size, quantisation, loaded state and port; `l`/`u` load
  and unload, `p` opens a pull prompt (catalog search with the same resolver as `models pull`), `d`
  deletes after a confirmation. A pull shows a progress bar, rate and ETA in place and moves to Downloads.
- **Downloads (iteration 3):** every transfer with progress, pause and cancel (`x`), errors with the same
  hints the CLI prints.
- **Setup (iteration 4):** the managed-runtime operation as a stepper (the `SetupState` machine from
  `src/engines/managed-environment.ts`); when a step needs elevation it shows the exact command to run in
  another shell and waits, exactly like the CLI's `manual` strategy.

### How it is built

- `src/tui/`: `state.ts` (one reducer), `keys.ts` (one key table that feeds the footer, the help and the
  handlers), `controller.ts` (the only side effects), `components/`, `screens/` (one per tab), `app.tsx`,
  `run-tui.tsx`. The command loads it with a dynamic `import()`, so plain commands never load React.
- Data: `watchDaemon` (`src/core-link/watch.ts`) attaches when a daemon runs, follows its events
  (snapshot first; `STATUS_EVENTS` refetch), and attaches again after a restart, found by `health()`.
  Actions go through the functions the commands use: `startDaemon`/`stopDaemon`, `setConfigValue`,
  `runChecks`, `followLog`. No URL, token or HTTP outside `src/core-link/`, and nothing written to
  stdout or stderr around the frame (attach takes the UI's logger).
- Rendering: Ink's alternate screen (the shell's scrollback returns untouched), rounded box frames, the
  16 named colours, off under `NO_COLOR`, `--no-color` or a non-colour terminal. Every card and log line
  is one line, cut with `…` at the frame, and lists render only what fits, since Ink cannot clip a frame
  taller than the terminal; below 40×12 the screen asks for a bigger terminal.
- Tests: pure tables for the reducer, keys (every footer hint must do something) and model; the Ink app
  on `test/helpers/fake-terminal.ts` (a TTY-like stdin and stdout of a fixed size); the controller on the
  fake `CoreLink`; a contract test that bare `atc` on a terminal opens it and `q` leaves with the daemon
  running; Ink itself under Node and `bun test` (runtime-compat); and the compiled binary in a real
  pseudo-terminal (e2e, POSIX). Windows Terminal is checked by hand.

## Cross-cutting work

- **Core changes still needed** (each a branch and a PR into `main`, then an exact pin bump here): a `host`
  field in the lock record so a client can tell an `atc` daemon from the core CLI's without
  `daemon.json`; the managed-runtime seams listed under iteration 4; `mmproj` in `downloadHfModel`.
- **Core release automation:** the `NPM_TOKEN` secret in the core repository makes its release workflow
  publish `@atomic-chat/core` by itself.
- **Core CI stability:** three runner flakes (Bun 1.3.10 segfault in `bun test` on macOS, the diffusion
  service test under coverage, the llama runtime load timeout on Windows arm) cost several reruns per
  release; raise those timeouts or retry those cases.
- **Windows service:** Bun binaries are not SCM-aware; a wrapper (WinSW or NSSM) or a small native shim
  is a decision for iteration 6.
