# The web admin

`packages/admin-ui` is the SPA the `atc` daemon serves on `http://127.0.0.1:1338`. It exists for the person
who would rather click than type: the same daemon, the same data, a browser instead of a terminal. This
page covers the stack, where the code comes from, how it talks to the daemon, and how to work on it.

## Stack

React 19, Vite 6, TanStack Router (file-based routes, `routeTree.gen.ts` generated), Zustand 5, Tailwind 4,
shadcn-style components (`@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`,
`lucide-react`). Tests: vitest with jsdom and Testing Library. Scripts in `packages/admin-ui/package.json`:
`dev`, `build` (`tsc -b && vite build`), `preview`, `typecheck`, `lint` (its own browser/React eslint
config; the root config ignores the package), `test`. It is an npm workspace of the root package; the root
`typecheck`, `lint` and `test:ui` scripts reach into it.

## Why copy-and-adapt from `Atomic-Chat/web-app`

The desktop app's `web-app/` already has the pages a server admin needs — API server, models and
downloads, backends, hardware, proxy settings — written against a `ServiceHub` whose Tauri implementations
call `invoke`. Its stack is the one above. Rather than write a second UI or extract a shared package (the
app and `atc` are separate products with separate release trains; ADR 2026-09-24
"Copy and adapt the desktop web app for the admin UI"), the admin **mirrors `web-app/src`'s structure**
(`routes/ containers/ components/ui/ hooks/ services/ stores/ lib/`) so that files lift 1:1, and replaces
exactly one seam: `invoke`.

What lifts as is: `stores/`, `components/ui/*`, the hooks and containers for the API server, downloads,
hardware and proxy config, `lib/hardware-tier.ts`, the model-search service and catalog registries (with
`fetch` swapped). What is rewritten thinly against the BFF routes: the Tauri `services/*/tauri.ts`
implementations, the models default service, the backend updater, `lib/utils.ts` (it pulls the extension
manager in the app), and `lib/platform.ts`, which reports a platform `'admin'` with every server feature
on. `ServiceHub` interface names are kept; `AdminServiceHub` implements the subset the admin needs.

## Provenance: the header and `LIFTED.md`

Every file taken from the app starts with

```ts
// Lifted from Atomic-Chat/web-app/src/<path> @ <commit>; adapted: <what changed, one line>
```

and has a line in `packages/admin-ui/LIFTED.md` (path here, path there, commit, adaptation). The point
is not attribution but repair: when the app fixes a bug in a lifted file, the header says which commit the
copy came from, so the fix can be pulled by diffing against it. A file without the header was written for
`atc`. There is no shared package with the app; the copies live here on their own.

## The bridge

`services/core-bridge.ts` exports `createHttpInvoke()`, which has the same shape as Tauri's `invoke` and
answers the three commands the app's core runtime uses:

| `invoke(command, args)` | In the app | Here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `atomic_core_call { method, path, body }` | Rust proxies to the core's `/atomic/v1` with the token | `fetch('/api/core' + path, { method, body })` with `X-Atc-Admin: 1` and the session cookie; the daemon checks the allowlist and adds the control token |
| `atomic_core_snapshot` | Rust | `GET /api/core/snapshot` |
| `atomic_core_status` | Rust | `GET /api/status` |

`services/atomic-core-runtime.ts` is a verbatim copy of the app's
`extensions/shared/atomicCoreRuntime.ts` — `createCoreRuntime(provider, invoke)` builds every request the
UI makes, parameterised by the `invoke` function and importing nothing. Wire types come from
`src/admin/contract` (the browser-safe folder of the root package: `AdminStatus`, `AdminConfigView`,
`SetupState`, `ADMIN_API`, `ADMIN_HEADER`, `SESSION_COOKIE`) and from `@atomic-chat/core/contracts`. The
control token never reaches the page; the page never knows the core's port.

Login: the SPA reads `#token=…` from the URL once, posts it to `POST /api/session`, drops the fragment
from the address bar and relies on the `HttpOnly` cookie from then on. A 401 anywhere means "open the URL
`atc admin` prints".

## Events (SSE)

`services/events.ts` opens `EventSource('/api/events')` — one stream carrying the core's events and
`atc:*` events (`atc:status`, `atc:log`, `atc:host-step`, `atc:download`), each with a relay id `r<n>`.
The browser's `EventSource` sends `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect; the daemon replays from its ring or sends
`resync`, on which the page re-fetches the snapshot. `useCoreEvents(name, handler)` is the hook, the
counterpart of the app's `atomic-core://<event>` listeners, so lifted hooks keep their shape. A change of
`instance_id` in the snapshot means a new core owns the folder: derived state is reset.

## Dev mode

```bash
atc admin --no-open                 # a daemon with the admin on 127.0.0.1:1338; note the token
cd packages/admin-ui && npm run dev # Vite on its own port, with server.proxy['/api'] → http://127.0.0.1:1338
```

Open the Vite URL with `#token=<token>` (from `atc admin token`) once; the cookie is set by the proxied
`/api/session` and the SSE stream is proxied too. A daemon started from source is
`node dist/bin.js admin --no-open` after `npm run build`.

## Build and embed

```bash
npm run build:ui        # packages/admin-ui/dist
npm run embed:ui        # scripts/embed-admin-assets.mjs → src/admin/static-assets.generated.ts
npm run build:bin       # runs embed:ui, then compiles the binary
```

The generated module holds every file of `dist/` gzipped and base64-encoded, keyed by path, plus
`ADMIN_BUILD_ID` (a sha256 prefix of the contents; `atc version` and the `x-atc-admin-build` response
header report it). Without a built SPA the script embeds `resources/admin-placeholder.html` with the
build id `placeholder`: a page that signs in with the token and shows `/api/status` as JSON, so `npm test`
and `build:bin` never need Vite. The generated file is gitignored. See ADR 2026-09-24 "Embed the admin
UI as a generated module".

Serving (`src/admin/static.ts`): hashed asset names get `cache-control: immutable`, everything else
`no-cache`; any path that is not a file gets `index.html`, so the router owns the URL space; CSP
`default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`.

## Pages

In order of value on a server. The scaffold ships the shell (root layout, sidebar, theme) and the
Dashboard; the other pages exist as routes with placeholder cards and lifted containers on fixtures.

| # | Page | Shows | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Dashboard | `/api/status` (versions, daemon, API endpoint, sessions, pending host steps), the snapshot, live events | works |
| 2 | API Server | Start/stop the `/v1` server, host/port/key, CORS, trusted hosts (lifted `containers/api/*`, `useLocalApiServer`) | iteration 5 |
| 3 | Models | Installed, hub search, downloads with progress and cancel (`POST /api/downloads/:id/cancel`) | iteration 5 |
| 4 | Engines / Backends | Installed packs, the optimal one, install/update | iteration 5 |
| 5 | Managed Environment wizard | `SetupState`: `not-installed → consent → elevating → installing → relogin-required / reboot-required → ready / failed`; the manual `sudo atc host-step exec …` command when the daemon cannot elevate | iteration 7 |
| 6 | Logs | `GET /api/logs`, live `atc:log` | iteration 7 |
| 7 | Settings | `atc` config (`PATCH /api/config`), proxy, privacy/telemetry, tokens; engine settings from `GET /api/engines/:p/schema` | iteration 7 (schemas: iteration 5) |
| 8 | Hardware | GPUs, VRAM, driver, compute capability, CPU extensions, what was pushed to the core | iteration 7 |

The corresponding BFF routes answer 501 with `ATC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` until their iteration; the pages
render that as "not yet in this build" rather than an error.
