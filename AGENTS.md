## 1. What this is

The server CLI of **Atomic Chat**: one binary, `atc`, that embeds `atomic-chat-core` (engines, models, the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1` server) and adds what a server needs — a daemon that owns the data folder, a web
admin on loopback, the hardware facts the core cannot measure itself, and the privileged host steps of
managed runtimes. `atc` is a separate product from the desktop app; they share the core and nothing else.

This iteration is the **scaffold**: real where the core already does the work (daemon lifecycle, health,
admin shell, config, doctor, the terminal UI), stubs that exit 3 everywhere else. `src/cli/not-implemented.ts`
is the map of what is stubbed and when it lands. Bare `atc` on an interactive terminal opens the terminal UI
(Ink, `src/tui/`); anywhere else it prints help and exits 2 — scripts never get a screen.

## 2. Repository map

| Path                    | What lives there                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/bin.ts`            | The only file with side effects on import: real I/O, the daemon spawner, `process.exit`.            |
| `src/main.ts`, `src/io.ts` | `runCli(argv, io, deps)`; `AtcIo` (real or recording) — nothing else touches `process.stdout`.   |
| `src/cli/`              | Command framework: specs, `parseArgs` parsing, help, completion, context, the stub registry.         |
| `src/commands/`         | The command tree (`ROOT`); one file per command or group; stubs in `stubs.ts`.                      |
| `src/config/`           | `AtcPaths`, the config field table (`schema.ts`), parsers, migrations, layered resolution, files.   |
| `src/errors/`           | `AtcError`, its codes, exit codes, the one rendering of any failure. Depends on nothing.            |
| `src/output/`           | Printer (human/JSON), tables, progress, prompts, logger, colours.                                    |
| `src/core-link/`        | The only place with a core URL or token: attach-or-spawn, `HttpCoreLink`, SSE and in-process events, `daemon.json`. |
| `src/daemon/`           | The long-lived process: core in-process, admin, hardware push, host-step loop, run record; the spawner. |
| `src/host/`             | `exec`, host facts, elevation strategies, host-step executor and helper, hardware prober, service templates, ports. |
| `src/admin/`            | The admin BFF: gates, token, sessions, allowlisted proxy, SSE relay, embedded SPA. `contract/` is browser-safe. |
| `src/tui/`              | The terminal UI (Ink, `.tsx`): one reducer, one key table, a controller that is its only side effect, a screen per tab. Loaded lazily by `atc tui`. |
| `src/models/` `src/engines/` `src/update/` `src/doctor/` | Interfaces, pure parsers and tables for later iterations; the doctor's check table. |
| `packages/admin-ui/`    | The web admin SPA (React, Vite, Tailwind), copied and adapted from the desktop `web-app`.           |
| `test/`                 | `contract/` (fake core and real core), `e2e/` (the built program), `runtime-compat/`, `helpers/`, `setup.ts`. |
| `scripts/`              | Core preparation, binary build, SPA embedding, release, installers, gates, docs generation.          |
| `docs/`                 | Architecture, testing, release, admin UI, generated `commands.md`, `decisions/` (ADRs).             |

## 3. Code rules

1. **One module = one folder with `index.ts` as the only public entry.** A sibling module is imported
   only through its `index.ts` (eslint `no-restricted-imports` pattern `../*/!(index)`). Export deliberately.
2. **Policy is pure, I/O is separate.** Parsers, selectors, tables and plans take data and return data;
   `fs`, `child_process`, `net`, `fetch` live in a few named files. `env`, `fetch`, `exec`, `now`,
   `platform` are injected through options or `AtcIo`; never read `process.platform` inside policy code.
3. **Runtime-agnostic.** The same code runs under Node in tests and inside the Bun binary. Only `node:*`
   builtins (always with the prefix) and global `fetch`; no `Bun.*`, `bun:*`, native addons,
   `worker_threads` or branching on `process.versions.bun`. `scripts/check-runtime-agnostic.mjs` and eslint
   fail otherwise. The runtime choice lives in `scripts/build-binaries.mjs` alone.
4. **Errors** are `AtcError { code, message, details?, hint? }`; codes in `src/errors/errors.ts`. The
   core's `AtomicCoreError` passes through unchanged. Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` error, `2` usage, `3`
   `ATC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `130` interrupted. `--json`: one document on stdout, errors as JSON on stderr.
5. **`src/admin/contract/` is browser-safe:** types and string constants only, no `node:*`, only type
   imports from the rest of `atc`; core shapes come from `@atomic-chat/core/contracts`.
6. **Naming.** Files `kebab-case.ts`; React components `PascalCase.tsx`; classes `PascalCase`, functions
   `camelCase`. Wire fields `snake_case` as the core spells them.
7. **300 lines per file.** Split before you cross it.
8. **Tests next to the source** (`foo.ts` ↔ `foo.test.ts`), table-driven for policy code.
9. **Lifted admin files keep their provenance header** (`// Lifted from Atomic-Chat/web-app/src/<path> @
   <commit>; adapted: …`) and a line in `packages/admin-ui/LIFTED.md`.
10. **Every dependency needs a reason.** Runtime deps today: `atomic-chat-core`; `ink` and `react`, for
    `src/tui/` only. Adding one needs an explicit "ok" from the owner and an ADR.
11. **Do only what was asked.** No drive-by refactors; propose them. **Never commit unless asked.**
12. **Record non-trivial decisions** as a file in `docs/decisions/` (template `_TEMPLATE.md`) plus one
    line in `INDEX.md`, in the same session.
13. **Everything in the repo is English** — code, comments, commit messages, docs, scripts and their output.

## 4. Commands

```bash
bun install                     # @atomic-chat/core from npm, the admin-ui workspace (bun.lock is committed)
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run format:check
npm test                        # unit + contract on Node
npm run build                   # dist/ (needed by e2e from source and by docs:commands)
npm run docs:commands           # regenerate docs/commands.md (CI checks it is current)
npm run build:ui && npm run embed:ui && npm run build:bin   # SPA → generated module → dist/bin/atc-<triple>
npm run test:e2e && npm run test:runtime-compat && bun test test/runtime-compat
npm run verify                  # every gate, as CI runs them — run before finishing
```

Node 22 is the development and test runtime; Bun 1.3.10 installs dependencies and compiles; scripts run
through `npm run`, as in the core. Code never knows which runtime it is on.

---

## 5. How a command is built

A command is a `CommandSpec` (`src/cli/command.ts`): `name`, `summary`, `description`, `group`
(`run` | `models` | `access` | `system`), `options` (string/boolean, `parseArgs` strict), `positionals`,
`subcommands`, `defaultSubcommand`, `examples`, `hidden`, and `run(invocation, ctx)` returning the exit
code. Help, `docs/commands.md` and `atc completion` render from the spec, so nothing drifts. Global flags
are stripped once by `splitGlobalFlags` before the command parses its own.

A stub is `notImplemented(spec)`: same strict parsing and help, `run` throws `ATC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` naming
the iteration from `PLANNED` in `src/cli/not-implemented.ts`. `not-implemented.test.ts` asserts that every
stub in the tree is registered and every registry entry is a stub. Partial stubs of working commands
(`logs --follow`, `update apply`, `config engine.*`) are in `PLANNED_PARTIAL`.

`run` gets a `CommandContext`: `io`, `flags`, `paths`, `config()` (lazy), `out` (printer: `result(json,
humanFn)`), `log`, `prompt`, `core.attach({ launch })`, `host`, `now`, `signal`. Output goes through
`ctx.out`; diagnostics through `ctx.log` (stderr). `ctx.prompt.confirm` honours `--yes` off a terminal and
otherwise fails with `ATC_CONSENT_REQUIRED`.

---

## 6. Testing

Five layers (`vitest.config.ts`, details in `docs/testing.md`):

- **unit** — `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`, next to the code, pure tables and fakes; the Ink app on
  `test/helpers/fake-terminal.ts`.
- **contract** — `test/contract/`: commands against `FakeCoreLink` (`commands.test.ts`); the daemon against
  a real `AtomicCore` in a temporary folder (`daemon.test.ts`): lock, token, run record, admin auth, proxy, SSE.
- **e2e** — `test/e2e/`: the built program (`dist/bin/atc-*` when present, else `node dist/bin.js`); the
  terminal UI in a real pseudo-terminal (Python's `pty`, POSIX).
- **runtime-compat** — `test/runtime-compat/`: Node behaviours the daemon relies on, and Ink's raw keys and
  resize, under vitest **and** `bun test`.
- **ui** — `packages/admin-ui`, its own vitest (jsdom).

`test/setup.ts` points `ATC_DATA_FOLDER` and `ATOMIC_CORE_DATA_FOLDER` at a fresh `mkdtemp` per worker;
`test/helpers/tmp-data-folder.ts` gives a folder per test. No test touches a real data folder, spawns a real
engine, or reaches the network. Helpers: `testRun()` (recording I/O + fake core + fake host),
`fakeCoreLink()`, `fakeHost()`, `fakeCoreFactory()`.

Every exported function has a unit test; every user-visible flow has a contract test and, once it works in
the binary, an e2e test. Verify before finishing: `npm run verify`; for `src/daemon/` or `src/host/`
changes also say which OS you ran e2e on.

---

## 7. Checklists

**Add a command.** Spec in `src/commands/<name>.ts` (or a group file); add it to `ROOT` in
`src/commands/index.ts` in help order; if it is a stub, `notImplemented()` + a `PLANNED` line; unit test
for any pure helper; contract test in `test/contract/commands.test.ts`; `npm run build && npm run
docs:commands`; e2e case when it works in the binary.

**Add a config field.** One line in `FIELDS` (`src/config/schema.ts`) with type, default, description
(min/max/values as needed) and the matching key in the `AtcConfig` type; a `schema.test.ts`/`parse.test.ts`
case; the env name derives from the path (`api.port` → `ATC_API_PORT`); `config list`, `config set` and
`GET /api/config` pick it up. A schema change bumps `CONFIG_VERSION` and adds a `MIGRATIONS` step.

**Add an admin route.** Path constant in `src/admin/contract/routes.ts`, wire types in `contract/api.ts`
(browser-safe); handler in `src/admin/bff.ts` behind the session check; for a core passthrough, extend
`READ_ALLOW`/`WRITE_ALLOW` instead — never `/shutdown`, `/clients`, telemetry consent or cloud keys; a
`bff.test.ts` case and a `test/contract/daemon.test.ts` request; the SPA service that calls it.

## 8. The core

The core (`@atomic-chat/core`, repo `atomic-chat-core`) is embedded at an exact npm version, never a caret
(`docs/release.md`). What comes from where:

| Entry point                  | Used for                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `atomic-chat-core`           | `AtomicCore.create` in the daemon, `AtomicCoreError`, `CORE_VERSION`, hardware/session types.    |
| `@atomic-chat/core/host`      | Data-folder rules (`resolveCliDataFolder`, `assertCliDataFolder`, `dataLayout`), the lock read side (`inspectLock`, `waitForPublishedOwner`), `attachToOwner`, `selfCommand`, `openInBrowser`. |
| `@atomic-chat/core/client`    | `CoreClient` (control API, SSE `events`, `request`), `CoreSnapshot`, `CoreEventMessage`.          |
| `@atomic-chat/core/contracts` | Browser-safe wire types for `src/admin/contract` and the SPA.                                    |
| `@atomic-chat/core/models`, `/downloads` | Reserved for iteration 3 (`ModelInstaller` over `Downloader` and `downloadHfModel`). |

Rule: **never copy core logic — request an export.** Lock semantics, attach, downloads, `model.yml` and
engine selection belong to the core; a missing export is a change in the core branch (plan §9), not a copy
here. The one deliberate mirror is `src/host/managed-types.ts` (types from the core's `feat/tenzor-rt`
branch), which becomes re-exports once that branch lands. The core never probes GPUs itself; the daemon
pushes `PUT /hardware/override` after start.

## 9. Keeping this file small

Target ≤ 200 lines. No decision log here — one ADR per file under `docs/decisions/`. No duplication with
`docs/`; link instead. When they disagree, the linked doc wins and this file gets fixed.
