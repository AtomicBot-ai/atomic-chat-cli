/**
 * `<data>/atc/run/daemon.json`: what the `atc` daemon publishes about itself beyond the core's

 * an `atc` daemon at all, not the core's own CLI daemon on the same folder (which has no admin
 * server and no host-step loop). It is written as `starting` the moment the core is up, before the
 * slow parts (hardware probe, admin listener), and rewritten as `ready` after them. A record whose
 * `instance_id` differs from the lock's is stale.
